We are announcing the decommissioning of our forum. The forum was one of a few experiments to see which tools would best foster a collaborative environment.

After running it for eight months we have come to the conclusion that our forum is not an important platform for our communication. For our inter-team communications we enjoy using [Slack][slack], for project discussions we use [GitHub Issues][github] and for external communications we have found [Twitter][twitter] and our [website][lab-website] cover all bases.
