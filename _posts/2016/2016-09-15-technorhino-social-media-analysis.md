## Introduction
If you didn't know, [#technorhino][#Technorhino] is our resident [Great Big Rhino](http://www.greatbigrhinos.org.uk), who you can read all about [here](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/raspberry-pi/outreach/iot/technorhino/2016/08/16/the-story-of-an-led-rhino.html). This article is going to focus on and compare the social media interest generated in both [#technorhino][#Technorhino] and [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino] during and following our visit to the [RAM Museum](https://rammuseum.org.uk/technorhino-visits-ramm/).

## Social media and #technorhino
Deeply embedded into this project from the very beginning was the use of social media as a public interaction tool. The [#technorhino][#Technorhino] project made huge use of Twitter, specifically keyword hashtags. As you can see the whole project was named after our chosen keyword hashtag, [#technorhino][#Technorhino].

This keyword was used to activate preprogrammed themes. This was achieved by tweeting [#technorhino][#Technorhino] followed by #themename. These tweets would then be scraped from twitter and the #themename scraped from the individual tweet. If the theme name matched a preprogrammed theme it would be shown on the rhino.

This is how we used social media to our advantage. In order to change the rhino you needed to tweet it, which would in turn generate more interest in the project as a whole.

## Using this generated interest
To use this interest we decided to include [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino] in the required keyword. This meant every time someone wanted to change the rhino, traffic would be directed at the Great Big Rhino project as a whole. The idea behind this was to massively increase the social media noise behind the Great Big Rhino project and hopefully as a result get more people to participate in it. Since this is a charitable project, any increase in interest should lead to more funds being raised.

## The impact #technorhino made towards @GreatBigRhinos
That's all good in theory, but how did it work in practice? Using a few online tools, we could analyse the twitter traffic for both [#technorhino][#Technorhino] and [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino]. Since [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino] is included in all [#technorhino][#Technorhino] tweets, we could find out how many tweets the technorhino hash tag generated for the Great Big Rhino project.

Firstly, after we had finished in the RAMM we used a website called [trendsmap](http://trendsmap.com/local/gb/exeter) to provide a list of all the trending topics in Exeter. As you can see, we were trending! This came as a bit of a shock to us but we loved it none the less.

Something interesting to point out about this table is that not only is [#technorhino][#Technorhino] trending but also [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino] and the RAM Museum. So our theory actually works in practice! The rhino can be used to generate a lot of social media noise.

With this new found optimism I set about putting some hard numbers to this trending table. Again, using some online tools from [brand24.com](https://brand24.com) and [keyhole.co](http://keyhole.co) it was fairly straight forward to get this information.

These websites provide a lot information for your given search parameter: you can see all of this for both [#technorhino][#Technorhino] and [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino] by clicking on the respective images below.

[![Twitter numbers for @GreatBigRhinos](https://images.informaticslab.co.uk/articles/2016-09-14-technorhino-social-media-analysis/tweet-num-gbr.png)](https://images.informaticslab.co.uk/articles/2016-09-14-technorhino-social-media-analysis/gbr-tracking.pdf)

The most useful number for me was simply just the number of posts for each keyword. This is useful as it allows you to see how many tweets for [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino] contained [#technorhino][#Technorhino]. As you can see from above we had:
• 171 posts for [#technorhino][#Technorhino]
• 545 posts for [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino]

A quick bit of maths reveals that about **31%** of all tweets for [@GreatBigRhinos][@GreatBigRhino] contained [#technorhino][#Technorhino]. This is something we are really proud of and it shows that [#technorhino][#Technorhino] has had the effect it was built to make.  

## Summary
Hopefully that has shown what can be achieved with social media if it is used in an engaging and productive way. It also acts to highlight that this project has succeeded in its goal of promoting the Great Big Rhinos Project and expanding its audience to new and exciting places.  

So now all that is left to do is tweet [#technorhino][#Technorhino] yourself!
