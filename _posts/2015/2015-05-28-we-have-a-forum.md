We now have a forum which you can find at [community.informaticslab.co.uk][forum]!

We've created this forum to allow open discussion of everything happening in the lab. Anyone is welcome to sign up and join in the conversation.

The forum is built with [NodeBB][nodebb] and uses our own [custom theme][nodebb-theme-informatics] which anyone can contribute to, so if you want to make the forum even better then open a pull request there.
