Only two weeks old and still crawling but ... hey, we are gathering speed quickly!

Our 1.0 web and blog are up (yep, this one you are reading. 2.0 coming soon!), our first prototype is shaping up ([take a look](https://github.com/msaunby/uk-weather-3d/tree/local-dem)) and in May we will be at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter to test the prototype.

The Lab is also growing in size, we currently have around fifty lab associates inside the Met Office and a few from the outside world â€¦ including some [unexpected tweeting members](https://twitter.com/LabbyTheRat). Anyway, always looking for ways to learn and improve what we do so let us know what you think. All comments welcome.
