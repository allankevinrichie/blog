The Met Office Science Department develops important new capabilities every year by upgrading the models that underpin our weather and climate prediction. They improve our analytical techniques and generate new datasets that detail the global environment. Scientists wanted an engaging and accessible tool to help promote their pipeline of planned new advances across the office, and saw KnightLab’s open-source [timeline.js][timeline-js] tool.

We in the Informatics Lab were able to help by sharing our web development skills with our science colleagues. This empowered them to tailor the timeline’s functionality to suit their needs, creating an important reference for the office to use.

This is a great example of cross office collaboration and skills sharing between different disciplines in the organisation. The tool is now being used around the office and has received great feedback.
