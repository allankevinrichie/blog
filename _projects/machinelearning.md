## Project Description

Statistician George Box said, “all models are wrong, but some are useful”. This project will use machine learning to spot and extract this useful information. This will allow us to link different computer models together more effectively. It will also allow us to better link these models to the real world so we can predict the things we care about. 

### Connecting models

The real world is complex. To make sense of it, we can use computer models - calculations which represent and predict different parts of the real world.

Each of these models has its own way of describing the world; a language of entities and effects. This language determines what the model can describe, and what is beyond its scope.

What if the thing we would like to predict can’t be described by any single model? By understanding each model's limitations, we can begin to combine them to predict a broader range of effects.

### Learning connections

There are any number of ways we could link models together. How can we be sure of making a good choice? 

If we have lots of past records of the thing we are trying to predict, this is easy. We can just check if our combination of models gives the right answers. If not, we can tweak the links to make it better.

This process is known as machine learning. Machine learning is a name for algorithms which iteratively learn from data. If you have a lot of examples of how you want a function or mapping to behave, a machine learning algorithm can learn to approximate it.

By treating the real-world effect we'd like to predict as a target, we can use machine learning to find useful connections between models.

### Information flow

Another way of looking at these connections between models is as information transmitters. Ideal connections would pass only the important points from one model to the next, and not dilute them with useless detail.

If the useful information is very localised, this task is quite simple. However, in complex models useful information may be spread across the output. Machine learning can spot these diffuse patterns, and so rescue information that would otherwise be lost.

## Summary

Skillful predictions rely on the efficient transfer of information, from model to model, to final outcome. This project aims to optimize this chain, and make the best possible use of the information available.
